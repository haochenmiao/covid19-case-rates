# covid19-case-rates
### This project presents two interactive maps showing the spread of Covid-19 in the United States in 2020. The first map, titled "US Covid 2020 Rates," displays the Covid-19 rates among the counties in the US. When the user moves the mouse over a county, they are able to access the Covid-19 data for that specific county. The second map, titled "Covid 2020 cases in the US," displays the number of Covid-19 cases in each county. By clicking on a county or circle, the user can access the number of cases for that particular area. These maps provide valuable insights into the spread of Covid-19 in the US and can be used for research and analysis purposes.

#### The main function of the first map, Map1 a choropleth map that is to provide an interactive representation of the COVID-19 infection rates among counties in the United States in the year 2020. It allows users to view the infection rates of each county by hovering over the county with a mouse, providing access to the specific data for that county.

#### The data souces I use is from the [the United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/table?g=0100000US$050000&d=ACS+5-Year+Estimates+Data+Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true) and also the mapbox gl js library with Albers projection. Thanks to the help of my amazing classmate Gunhee Lee's collaboaration of debugging code.

#### This is the link to the map2, the second map
[map2.html](http://127.0.0.1:5500/map2.html)

#### The main function of the second map, map2 a roportional symbol map that is to provide a visual representation of the number of COVID-19 cases among the counties in the United States in 2020. The map allows users to interact with it by moving their mouse over the counties or circles to access data about the number of cases in each county. This helps users to easily understand the distribution of COVID-19 cases and to compare the situation in different counties.

#### The data sources I use is from [the different United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) and also the mapbox gl js library with Albers projection, where I collected the shapefile of the boundaries of the counties, and thanks to the help of my awesome classmates we are able to debug some of the issues in the html, css and javascript code to make this project appealing to the users
